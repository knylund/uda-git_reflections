Reflections on GIT course 

Sec. 1

Diff was kind of familiar, but I'm more used to the coloured output of
modern tools. Diff was somehow familiar, didn't know about fc on Windows.

Sec. 2

More efficient programmer -- At least committing a version often allows me to undo to last good state of the program, and committing often makes spotting the error faster.

Sec. 3
Pro and con of manually committing. Pro: Only the programmer understands what is a meaningful atomic change to the code. Con: Takes practice and discipline.

Sec. 4
Multiple file commits... They are a feature for those vcs:s that are aimed at coding. 

Sec. 6
Confidence... It's easier to do drastical changes when there's a known good version to go back to. Also the changes can be done in a few iterations.

Sec. 7 how I want to use GIT: Start storing my private projects there, not just locally on work computer.
